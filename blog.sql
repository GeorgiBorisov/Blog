(1, 'What is Lorem Ipsum?', '/images/bridge.jpeg', 'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum!!', '2018-12-17 08:41:06', '2018-12-17 08:41:06'),
(2, 'Why do we use it?', '/images/mountain.jpeg', 'It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \'Content here, content here\', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \'lorem ipsum\' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).', '2018-12-17 08:41:31', '2018-12-17 08:41:31'),

(4, 'JavaScript', '', 'Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.', '2019-01-12 22:07:03', '2019-01-12 22:07:03'),
(5, 'NodeJS', '', 'Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Typically, JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage\'s HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user\'s web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user\'s web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.', '2019-01-12 22:07:19', '2019-01-12 22:07:19'),
(6, 'ReactJS', '', 'ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook\'s newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.', '2019-01-12 22:07:33', '2019-01-12 22:07:33'),
(7, 'Vue JS', '/images/vue.png', 'Vue.js features an incrementally adoptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.\r\nVue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He later summed up his thought process: \"I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight.\" Vue was originally released in February 2014.', '2019-01-13 08:16:49', '2019-01-13 08:16:49');
